# Trading Strategy QSTrader

This is patched and bug fixed version for [QSTrader library](https://github.com/mhallsmoore/qstrader). This package is a dependency for [tradingstrategy](https://github.com/tradingstrategy-ai/client) package.

The QSTrader project was forked and the fork released on a different PyPi package name `tradingstrategy-qstrader` because the original project by Michael Halls-Moore was unmaintained and unusable as a PyPi package dependency.

[For more information see the original QSTrader Github](https://github.com/mhallsmoore/qstrader) and [Trading Strategy website](https://tradingstrategy.ai/).
